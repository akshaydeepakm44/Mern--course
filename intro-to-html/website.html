where as the box model is a way to visualize the size of an element and its padding, border, and margin. -->

spacing inside is padding, 
spacing outside is margin,
border is the line around the element.

by default the browser tries to align the elements in a way that they are not overlapping each other.so we get all the text in a single line.

vertical-align = top, middle, bottom, baseline
